For these 2 years, I had the opportunity to do so many things but my favoite one was playing with children between 2,5 and 12 years old. I organised sessions with DIY, kooking and tales, awakening of the senses, dynamics hobbies,...

                            <p>My first student job! I was 16 and I had the mission to help <strong>deliver</strong> hot meals for old and/or disabled people. We collected the dishes from the day before and when the round was finished, prepared it for the dishwasher for the next day. I really liked it because I could meet a lot of people, and I knew I was helpful.</p>
